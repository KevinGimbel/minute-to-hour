# minute-to-hour
A simple ReactJS Minute to Hour converted I made to get to know ReactJS.
 
I made this thing one with [Vanilla JS](http://codepen.io/kevingimbel/pen/OPVbWy/) because I hated to calculate all the minute-to-hour things for our work's Call Tracker when I forgot to turn on time tracking. The reason I rebuild it now in React is because I want to get to know React better - it's the first thing I ever did in React so feel free to give [feedback and critic](https://twitter.com/_kevinatari), it's always appreciated!
